Step 4: Edit the pages to your heart's content (but do split unrelated changes into multiple requests). If you would like to bring your edits to the next level, consider reading up on the [markdown ](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/editing-pages)format GitBook uses.

Step 6: \
Method 1 (preferred): join the modding discord and send a message in the wiki channel about your change request. Questions and suggestions will be discussed there.

Method 2: (if you don't want to join discord) The change request will be reviewed and you may receive comments with questions, suggestions, and discussion. They will have to be resolved before merging.

Step 7: When all discussion is resolved, the change request is merged.
