Partly an explanation on how level generation works, mostly a list of all geomorphs and what they look like.

## [Weapon guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnMhPE5eB0xHsHEETj7XGD\_f8hyjYRoweNfqpdeNDxQ/edit)

Explains most things about how weapons work and how to make them.

## [Datablock (level layout) editor](https://gtfo-modding.github.io/DatablockEditor/)

A way to make level layout blocks online instead of working with JSON.

## [Unity setup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZsEVyd81Rqk3VF5xYyQa\_g56glqqM5qJk2oFmX\_jgts/edit)

Mostly focused on how to setup unity for making geomorphs, but works for datamining unity assets and making other things in unity as well.

Major update soon.

## [OriginalDataBlocks (TypeList)](https://github.com/UntiIted/OriginalDataBlocks)
