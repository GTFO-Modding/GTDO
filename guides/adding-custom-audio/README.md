#### What is Wwise?

Audiokinetic Wwise is a software development kit (SDK) for audio content creation and integration in games and other interactive media, the tool used by 10CC to integrate audio into GTFO. Wwise also includes a soundbank system, which allows developers to organize and access their audio content, using sound events. To add custom sounds to GTFO, we will have to use Wwise and create SoundBanks within the application.

#### What is a SoundBank?

A SoundBank is a container of sound events, and the objects and audio data required to play them.  GTFO uses SoundBanks created by Wwise to play all of its audio in-game, ranging from its dynamic music system to enemy sound effects.

#### What is BroSoundDependency?

BroSoundDependency is my update to NekOwO\_Wafer's outdated plugin "Audio Dependency" which injects SoundBanks into GTFO through BepInEx. This is required to add custom SoundBanks to GTFO. The plugin is available on the GTFO Modded Thunderstore page:

**Who is Mr Bro?**

Hi there, my name is Mr. Bro and I'm a big fan of the video game GTFO. Everyone has been asking for ways to add custom sound and here is a guide on how to do so! Looking into it I have found a way how to use Wwise to create custom soundbanks and have created a plugin to put these soundbanks into GTFO. Personally it was very difficult at first, but I look forward to hearing feedback from other players and continuing to improve my creations!
