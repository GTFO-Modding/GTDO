You also probably want to use audacity to convert audio files to the **.wav** file format, because that's what Wwise requires. The download link is below.

**Step 2:** Using Wwise version **2017.1.9.6501** create a new project, and uncheck all of the asset groups, none are required for our SoundBanks.
