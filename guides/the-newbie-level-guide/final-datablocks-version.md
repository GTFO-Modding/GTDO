# Final datablocks version

Since R6 is gone now and so are the source blocks, some things have changed and the guide may be hard to follow. Or perhaps you just want to check/copy a specific block. Either way, the guide blocks are now stored on git:

You can also check out the commits to see any changes made since initial release. I will also cover some changes here as well.

### R7 update

Since MTFO now supports loading only specific blocks (also to fix some crap broken by R7 like players' shoes, shooters with pouncer stance and so on), the blocks have been minimized.

Additionally, the exit zone size has been changed so the max size isn't reached before exit geomorph is generated.

Here's the new map:
